## My process
Everything started by layout being designed in HTML5 and CSS3. The form is completely responsive. For validating the forms I have used RegEX rules for matching with valid formats of each input

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure JavaScript
- RegEX filtering
